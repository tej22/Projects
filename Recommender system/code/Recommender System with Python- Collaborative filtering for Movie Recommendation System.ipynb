    "\n",
    "To experiment with recommendation algorithms, we’ll need data that contains a set of **items** and a set of **users** who have reacted to some of the items.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reaction can be:\n",
    " - Explicit (rating on a scale of 1 to 5, likes or dislikes)\n",
    " - Implicit (viewing an item, adding it to a wish list, the time spent on an article).\n",

    "### Questions that need to be answered\n",
    " - How do you determine which users or items are similar to one another?\n",
    " - Given that you know which users are similar, how do you determine the rating that a user would give to an item based on the ratings of similar users?\n",
    " - How do you measure the accuracy of the ratings you calculate?\n",
    " \n",
    " The First two questions have multiple answers - depending on the kind of algorithm you choose.  \n",

    "To find the rating **R** that a user **U** would give to an item I, the approach includes:\n",

In the case of matrices, a matrix A with dimensions m x n can be reduced to a product of two matrices X and Y with dimensions m x p and p x n respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reduced matrices actually represent the users and items individually. The m rows in the first matrix represent the m users, and the p columns tell you about the features or characteristics of the users. The same goes for the item matrix with n items and p characteristics. Here’s an example of how matrix factorization looks:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Downloads/dim.png\"  style =\"width:600px; height:400px/\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image above, the matrix is reduced into two matrices. The one on the left is the user matrix with m users, and the one on top is the item matrix with n items. The rating 4 is reduced or factorized into:\n",
    "\n",
    " - A user vector (2, -1)\n",
    " - An item vector (2.5, 1)\n",
    " \n",
    "The two columns in the user matrix and the two rows in the item matrix are called latent factors and are an indication of hidden characteristics about the users or the items. A possible interpretation of the factorization could look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Assume that in a user vector (u, v), u represents how much a user likes the Horror genre, and v represents how much they like the Romance genre.\n",
    "\n",
    " - The user vector (2, -1) thus represents a user who likes horror movies and rates them positively and dislikes movies that have romance and rates them negatively.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Assume that in an item vector (i, j), i represents how much a movie belongs to the Horror genre, and j represents how much that movie belongs to the Romance genre.\n",
    "\n",
    " - The movie (2.5, 1) has a Horror rating of 2.5 and a Romance rating of 1. Multiplying it by the user vector using matrix multiplication rules gives you (2 * 2.5) + (-1 * 1) = 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the movie belonged to the Horror genre, and the user could have rated it 5, but the slight inclusion of Romance caused the final rating to drop to 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of latent factors affects the recommendations in a manner where the greater the number of factors, the more personalized the recommendations become. But too many factors can lead to overfitting in the model."
